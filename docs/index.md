This library is based on the CryptoExchange.Net base library. General usage/configuration information can be found in the [CryptoExchange.Net documentation](https://jkorf.github.io/CryptoExchange.Net)

## Discord
A Discord server is available [here](https://discord.gg/MSpeEtSY8t). Feel free to join for discussion and/or questions around the CryptoExchange.Net and implementation libraries.

## Support the project
I develop and maintain this package on my own for free in my spare time, any support is greatly appreciated.

### Referral link
Sign up using the following referral link to pay a small percentage of the trading fees you pay to support the project instead of paying them straight to Binance. This doesn't cost you a thing!
